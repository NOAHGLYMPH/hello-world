    <h1>How Cyberattacks, have become the new norm for web users</h1>
    <p>It seems that on a daily basis cyberattacks are occurring on a daily basis. Corporations, Gaming sites, and even email providers, get attacked by cyberanarchists.
    Most do it for fun, others are intent on protesting or shutting down sites that they dislike. Whatever the reason cyberattacks be very dangerous for companies. 
    It can ruin their sites, many hackers steal info and force owners to pay them money just to get it back.
    But for normal everyday users this is just seen as a simple annoyance. A nuisance if you will. Corporation CEO's risk losing investors, if they appear to not be safe against attacks.
    Part of this meteoric rise can be attributed to the impressively soaring ad dollars being pumped into the Women's World Cup games in 2014. 
    The risks of cyberterrorism are no joke. They can compromise:</p>
    <ul> 
    <li>Jobs</li>
    <li>Financial Security</li>
    <li>Destroy Buisnesses</li>
    <li>Ransomware can make buisness owners bankrupt</li>
    <li>It makes people afraid to use the internet</li>
    
    
   <p>But although the fear of cyberterrorism may be manipulated and exaggerated, we can neither deny nor ignore it. 
   Paradoxically, success in the "war on terror" is likely to make terrorists turn increasingly to unconventional weapons, such as cyberterrorism. 
   And as a new, more computer-savvy generation of terrorists comes of age, the danger seems set to increase.</p>

    <p>Psychological, political, and economic forces have combined to promote the fear of cyberterrorism. From a psychological perspective, 
    two of the greatest fears of modern time are combined in the term "cyberterrorism."
    The fear of random, violent victimization blends well with the distrust and outright fear of computer technology.</p>
